You can run the application using one of the following methods:

#### üîß Method 1: Using a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies separately from your global Python installation.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gamingpro237/Advanced_Interview_responder_with_AI.git
   cd Advanced_Interview_responder_with_AI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - **On Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS and Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Download and Specify the Path for the Vosk Model**.

6. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment** (after you're done):

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Method 2: Normal Setup (Without Virtual Environment)

If you prefer to install the dependencies globally without using a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gamingpro237/Advanced_Interview_responder_with_AI.git
   cd Advanced_Interview_responder_with_AI
   ```

2. **Install the Required Libraries**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
